## 🙌 About Me
My name is Edin. At 22, I'm a seasoned front-end developer from Bosnia and Herzegovina with 3+ years of experience. I enjoy diving into diverse projects, being presented with unique tasks, and being confronted with challenges. I like creating with the skills I've honed, while also embracing new technologies as they come, depending on the needs of a project.

I'm someone who is driven and has a reliable approach when it comes to any task or situation I undertake. I have a keen interest in designing visually appealing and functional websites and applications. Additionally, I am adaptable, cooperative, and work well in any team environment.

Besides some simple things in life, like waking up, having breakfast, socializing, taking a shower, watching youtube, etc., I also enjoy participating in activities like going for a hike, hitting the gym, grilling, occasional travel, and pc enthusiasm.
